You are reading my personal notes on setting up a self-hosted server (a.k.a homelab) using Proxmox. This is not a tutorial, but more of an anecdotal documentation of my own experience. My main reason for writing this is to log my journey in self-hosting and to share my experience with hobbyists who are interested in self-hosting but don't know where to start. I know that there are already many good tutorials on setting up a homelab, but I hope this can be a good starting point for you to get into self-hosting and have fun with it!

## My Hardware

As a full-time student and part-time hobbyist, I have a limited budget for my homelab. Thus, I digged into the pile of old tech gadgets in my dad's garage and decided to utilized the following as my set up:

- **ThinkPad T450 (Intel i5-5300U/Intel HD Graphics 5500/8GB RAM/228GB SSD)** *(Proxmox server)*
- **A 2TB WD Purple** *(storage)*

## My Softwares

- **Proxmox VE** *(virtualization platform)*
- **Portainer** *(Docker management)*
- **Nextcloud** *(file hosting service)*
- **AdGuard Home** *(network-wide ad blocker)*
- **Immich** *(personal photo backu)*
- **Navidrome** *(personal music server)*
- **Jellyfin** *(personal media server)*
- **Vaultwarden** *(password manager)*
- **Nginx Proxy Manager** *(reverse proxy)*
- **Grafana/Prometheus** *(monitoring and alerting)*
- **n8n** *(workflow automation)*
